This is readme file for backend in which we practice and learn all about backend and handle data received from user in different format.

I am using node <b>18.19.0</b> and npm <b>10.2.3</b> in this project. 

We will use nodejs, express, mongoose and mongodb. We will also learn to use 3rd party libraries and packages and services to handle images.
